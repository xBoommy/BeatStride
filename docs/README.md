# Beat Stride
Hello! Welcome to our Application, Beat Stride!

## About the App
BeatStride is an Android application using React-native that incorporates both GPS tracking and Spotify player, providing a convenient platform for users to integrate running and music as one. It is designed to provide musical entrainment (synchronisation of music to action) for users while running, in place as a form of motivation. We believe that this can help users to attain their running goals and achieve a healthier lifestyle. 

**NOTE:** This app requires spotify app on your phone to run properly and spotify premium to function normally (to freely navigate between songs).
